## Technologies

```
React.js, Node.js, JavaScript, Docker, Cypress, Jest, Go.js
```

## System-Requirements 

- [git][git] v2.13 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] `12 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17`
- [npm][npm] v6 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up
properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

- Access to GitHub.com and a code editor such as vscode is necessary
- Go to [https://github.com/johnsonr84/react-bookshelf](https://github.com/johnsonr84/react-bookshelf)

To Clone
- Access to GitHub.com and a code editor such as vscode is necessary
- Click on the green button that says Clone or Download
- Choose how you would like to download: using the SSH/HTTPS keys or download the zip file
- Using SSH/HTTPS Key: You will copy the link shown and open up either terminal (mac: pre-installed) or gitbash (pc: must be installed). Once the application is open, you will type git clone paste url here. Once you have cloned the git repo, cd into the repo and type open. to open the folder which contains all files used for the app.

To Zip Download
- Download ZIP: Click on Download Zip. Locate the file and double click it to unzip the file. Locate the unzipped folder and open it. All the files for the website will be within this folder. Click on index.html to open the website in the browser.

To Fork
> [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
> first and then clone your fork rather than this repo directly.

After you've made sure to have the correct things (and versions) installed, you
should be able to just run a few commands to get set up:

```
git clone https://github.com:johnsonr84/react-bookshelf.git
cd react-bookshelf
node setup
```

This may take a few minutes.

If you get any errors, please read through them and see if you can find out what
the problem is. If you can't work it out on your own then please [file an
issue][issue] and provide _all_ the output from the commands you ran (even if
it's a lot).

If you can't get the setup script to work, then just make sure you have the
right versions of the requirements listed above, and run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run validate
```

If you are still unable to fix issues and you know how to use Docker üê≥ you can
setup the project with the following command:

```
docker-compose up
```

## Running the app

To get the app up and running (and really see if it worked), run:

```shell
npm start
``` 

If you just want to try how the app works, you can go to the link [here](https://react-bookshelf.netlify.app/)

## Running the tests

```shell
npm test
```

This will start [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) in watch mode. Read the output and
play around with it. The tests are there to help you reach the final version,
however _sometimes_ you can accomplish the task and the tests still fail if you
implement things differently than I do in my solution, so don't look to them as
a complete authority.

## Credits

I would like to credit Kent C Dodds "Build an Epic React App" course for teaching me the skills necessary to complete this blazingly fast application and to improve my understanding of building modern React apps using the latest technologies.
